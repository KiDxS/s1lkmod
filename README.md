`s1lkmod` is a command and control (C2) application that takes advantage of Discord for its communication channel. This allows users to easily set up a C2 platform for their red team or penetration testing engagements. 

**Target Model:** Low security

`s1lkmod` is composed of two components:
1. The Agent - the binary that will be deployed to the devices. (Only supports Windows)
2. The Builder - the binary that will build the agent with your configurations.
